## Executive Summary:

Recommendations: 
* Key campaign period: last 5 days of the month, with the focus on 0 am - 2 am and 10 am - 4 pm timeframe. 
* For high-value products: focuses on figuring out promotional tactics to convert from cart to purchase (for example, using discounts/exclusive deals with bundle deals) using further analyses on customer behaviors/price competitiveness analyses. 
* For low-value products: focuses on increasing in exposure via advertising, campaign landing pages, key digital assets to draw more traffic. 

Key insights: 
* Key shopping time focuses on the last 5 days of the month, and customers love staying up late (0 am - 2 am) to get the deals they want. They save products to cart and make purchase later on in the day (10 am - 2 pm / 4 pm).
* For high-value products: high view session counts, yet low conversion rate due to higher price range. 
* For low-value products: high conversion rate due to necessity with moderate session counts.
